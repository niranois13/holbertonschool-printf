NAME
    _printf

SYNOPSIS
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdarg.h>
    #include "main.h"

    int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
    The _printf function is a custom implementation of the printf function 
    from the C standard library. It formats and prints data to the standard
    output according to the format string specified by a format specifier.

    It interprets the format string and replaces format specifiers with the
    corresponding arguments.

RETURN VALUE
    Upon successful completion, the _printf function returns the number of
    characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to
    strings).

FORMAT SPECIFIERS
    The format string may contain format specifiers, each beginning with the
    percent character '%', followed by a format specifier character.
    
    The following format specifiers are supported:
        %c : Prints a single character.
        %s : Prints a null-terminated string.
        %d : Prints a signed integer.
        %i : Prints a signed integer
        %% : Prints a percent sign.

EXAMPLES
    To print a string:
        _printf("Hello, world!\n");

    To print a formatted string with variables:
        _printf("My name is %s and I am %d years old.\n", "Nicolas", 33);

    To print a formatted string with variables and a percent symbol:
        _printf("%s is %d%% a great human being.\n", Zakaria, 100);
